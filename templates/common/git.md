# Git & Conventional Commits Rules
- Use Conventional Commits v1.0.0 format for all commit messages.
- Format: `type(scope): description` (e.g., `feat(auth): add login endpoint`).
- Types: `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `docs` (documentation), `style` (formatting), `refactor` (code restructure), `perf` (performance), `test` (testing), `chore` (maintenance).
- Scope is optional but recommended (e.g., `api`, `service`, `domain`).
- Description should be imperative and start with lowercase.
- Use body for detailed explanations and footer for breaking changes or issues (e.g., `BREAKING CHANGE: ...`).
